This is the base program. It creates an agent that travels in a straight line between two points. Another agent is randomly generated and moves in a circular manner. 

Once compiled the program will be called **robot_waypoint**. To run:

```
./robot_waypoint outfile_path
```

The ```outfile_path``` determines where the two textfiles (**robot.txt**, **collider.txt**) are stored. These files contains the poses of the robot and collider respectively.
