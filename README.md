# DeepDECS: Capturing the uncertainity of Deep Neural Networks

This repo contains the code used for acquiring the results for [Discrete-Event Controller Synthesis for Autonomous Systems with Deep-Learning Perception Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03360).

There are two case studies explored:

- A robot mitigating collisions with a DNN to predict said collisions

- [Perceiving a human driver's state while in a self-driving car](https://www.york.ac.uk/assuring-autonomy/demonstrators/autonomous-driving/)
