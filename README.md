# Discrete-Event Controller Synthesis for Autonomous Systems with Deep-Learning Perception Components

This repo contains the following supplementary material:

- **augment_tool**: A python tool that automates the augmentation process in Stage 2 of DeepDECS.
- **case_studies**: Code, DNN models, datasets, and simulator setups used to investigate the two case studies; mobile robot collision limitation, and driver attentiveness management
- **tutorial**: There is a tutorial on how to use the DeepDECS process
