This program outputs the average time for the robot if a collision does not occur, and the average time when a collision does occur. The simulation will continue until there have been 5000 journeys that did not involve a collision, and 5000 journeys where a collision occurred. These are then used to calculate an average. 

Once compiled the program will be called **robot_time_avg**. To run:

```
./robot_time_avg
```

Once completed the average times will be displayed in the terminal.
