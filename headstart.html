<h3>Headstart 2019</h3>
</header>

<p>
	Welcome to the University of York 2019 Headstart programme website for the computer science session "I can see what you see - Looking through the eyes of a computer". On this page you will find links to the resources presented  on the day and some interesting links which you may wish to investigate after the session ends.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to continue investigating machine learning them I would recommend two books in particular:
</p>
<p> 
	<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3A15DWV62RHOW&keywords=geron+machine+learning&qid=1562579840&s=gateway&sprefix=geron+machine%2Caps%2C130&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</a> is a very good introduction to machine learning and, as the title suggests, has many practical exercises for the reader to follow.
</p>
<p> 
	<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PWH1Z8YOIQ4O&keywords=deep+learning+with+python&qid=1562579982&s=gateway&sprefix=Deep+Learning+with+P%2Caps%2C129&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Deep Learning with Python</a> is more focused on neural networks but is a very clear introduction to convolutional neural networks which play a key role in image classification tasks.
</p>
<p>
	A <a href="https://github.com/cap508/HeadStart2019" target ="_blank">github page</a> has been created from which all of the materials are available for download. 
</p>
<p>
	if you don't have a github account you can download most of the materials directly from the table below.
</p>
